# üìÅ How is data stored?

Molecule Labs leverages **Kamu** to ensure that all project data is stored in a fully decentralized, tamper-proof manner. By integrating Kamu‚Äôs Web3-native storage capabilities, Molecule Labs provides researchers and communities with reliable, auditable, and reproducible data access‚Äîeliminating single points of failure and guaranteeing data integrity over time.

Through Kamu‚Äôs architecture, data is written and maintained as **immutable event streams** in the **Open Data Fabric (ODF) format**, a Web3-native standard inspired by Apache Iceberg and built on Parquet files. (Learn more about ODF in the [Kamu documentation](https://docs.kamu.dev/odf/).) This combination gives each dataset a complete, cryptographically guaranteed history, making it straightforward to verify every change, audit provenance, and reproduce results. Key features include:

* **Tamper-Proof, Versioned Ledgers**\
  Kamu stores data as tamper-proof, versioned ledgers with cryptographic guarantees. Every modification to a dataset creates a new, immutable block in a chained series‚Äîforming a verifiable audit trail that makes data loss virtually impossible while ensuring full reproducibility.
* **Web3-Native ODF Format**\
  Data is serialized in the Open Data Fabric (ODF) format, which preserves full history (unlike many traditional formats that overwrite or compact old data). By keeping all historical versions intact, ODF ensures that teams can always roll back or inspect any prior state of their data.
* **Immutable Event Streams**\
  All records are written as event streams. Rather than overwriting tables in place, Kamu appends new events to the ledger. Each event is cryptographically committed, so anyone with the latest block hash can reconstruct the entire dataset from inception‚Äîguaranteeing consistency and transparency.
* **Cryptographic Commitments & Proofs**\
  Every change to the dataset generates a cryptographic commitment. These commitments are chained using content-addressable storage, meaning that any part of the data can be retrieved or verified via the hash of its latest block. Users can audit where data originated, who transformed it, and how it evolved, which makes the system resistant to malicious alterations.
* **Automatic Replication Across Storage Systems**\
  Kamu automatically replicates each ODF ledger across multiple decentralized storage backends. By distributing data redundantly, Molecule Labs ensures no single node or provider can become a point of failure. Even if one or more storage networks go offline, the data remains accessible from other replicas.
* **Complete, Verifiable Audit Trails**\
  Because every dataset is split into a series of cryptographically linked blocks, Molecule Labs can provide an end-to-end, timestamped record of all activities: data ingestion, transformation, validation, and consumption. This full audit trail fosters trust among researchers, community members, and external auditors‚Äîenabling data-driven decision-making with full confidence in provenance.

By adopting Kamu‚Äôs decentralized, history-preserving architecture, Molecule Labs delivers a storage solution where **data loss is virtually impossible**, **reproducibility is guaranteed**, and **trust is built into every ledger entry**.
