# üìÅ How is data stored?

Molecule Labs integrates Kamu, a Web3-native data engine, to give every research project a trust layer, creating a decentralized backbone where datasets live in many places at once, record their own histories, and can‚Äôt be quietly altered. Researchers and community members always see the same numbers‚Äîand can prove it.

#### How the Integration Works

* **Immutable Ledgers** ‚Äì Each update adds a new, permanent ‚Äúpage‚Äù instead of overwriting the old one.
* **Cryptographic Fingerprints** ‚Äì Every page is sealed with a unique hash; if anything changes later, the seal breaks and tampering is obvious.
* **Redundant Storage** ‚Äì Identical copies of the data live across multiple independent networks, eliminating single points of failure.
* **Versioning** ‚Äì Roll back to any past version of the dataset to reproduce results or track progress.

### Purpose of Molecule Labs

| Goal                                 | What it Means for You                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Guarantee Data Integrity**         | Protect research from silent edits, accidental deletions, and server outages.                                                                      |
| **Enable Transparent Collaboration** | Give funders, peers, and the wider community real-time, verifiable access to every milestone.                                                      |
| **Accelerate Reproducible Science**  | Preserve the full history of raw data and transformations so others can replicate findings with confidence.                                        |
| **Bridge Science and Markets**       | Feed rock-solid data into tools like the DeSci token screener (molecule.xyz), helping supporters make informed participation or trading decisions. |

### Why It Matters

* **Trust Built-In**\
  Anyone can audit who changed what‚Äîand when‚Äîwithout relying on a single company or server.
* **Zero Downtime Risk**\
  If one storage provider goes offline, your data stays live from the others.
* **Effortless Compliance & Review**\
  Grant agencies and journal reviewers can verify datasets independently, speeding up approvals.

### The Takeaway

By embedding Kamu‚Äôs tamper-proof, version-forever architecture into Molecule Labs, every project gains a bullet-proof data vault. That means safer research, faster collaboration, and deeper trust‚Äîfrom the lab bench all the way to the marketplace.
