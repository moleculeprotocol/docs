# üßë‚Äçüî¨ Submit a Project

Our mission at Molecule is to expedite translational R\&D by providing funding and support to research areas and stages currently underserved by traditional grants and venture capital funding. We seek to support scientific projects with commercial potential, especially those leading to tangible biomedical products like therapeutics and diagnostics. \


We are looking for committed researchers who are seeking efficient access to funding for their translational research projects. Through our Molecule Labs platform, we enable patrons of science to directly fund promising early-stage biotech research. In exchange for their support, funders receive intellectual property (IP) rights on terms set forth in a sponsored research agreement with the researcher.&#x20;

## Funding Model

The process is structured in phases from project preparation to successful funding. Here's what to expect when applying for funding:

**Preparation**

1. Prepare project materials either alone or in collaboration with a community
2. [Submit Project](https://moleculeprotocol.typeform.com/to/lBapA57t)
3. Review materials & Prepare for fundraise &#x20;

**After Launch**

3. Project is live and open for funding for your desired amount of time

#### Success&#x20;

5. Sponsored Research Agreement (or similar) is negotiated with university TTO and Sponsor
6. Agreement is signed and funds are transferred according to the payment schedule

#### Ongoing&#x20;

7. Provide sponsor and community with updates on project status and milestone completion

Molecule Labs lightweight tool to raise funds for your translational research. It can be used to find your community, get input on your project, and quickly start your work. There is no guarantee that the project will be funded, as it needs to reach the funding goal within the set time frame. If the project is not funded in time, all funds will be returned to funders. If the project is funded, then the project‚Äôs designated sponsor negotiates a sponsored research agreement with your university TTO and unlocks funds according to the milestone schedule.&#x20;

* Initiate discussion of potential IP agreements with TTO Phase I - Project Preparation

</details>

<details>

<summary>Phase II - Fundraise</summary>

**Week 9 to 12**&#x20;

* Molecule reviews materials for completion and supports research to set project for fundraise.
* Fundraise duration is fixed to the time duration of your choice using an all-or-nothing mechanism.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Phase III - Negotiation and Sponsorship</summary>

Week 1 to 24&#x20;

* Continuous engagement between researcher, TTO, sponsor, and Molecule to discuss contract terms

</details>

<details>

<summary>Phase IV - Execution</summary>

Until project completion

* Community designs governance frameworks and can exercise voting rights
* Researchers provide regular updates to the community
* Researchers complete deliverables according to milestone timelines
* Funds are transferred to the university according to deliverable and payment schedule
