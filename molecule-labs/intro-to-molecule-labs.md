# ðŸ§ª Intro to Molecule Labs

## What is Molecule Labs?

**Molecule Labs** are an integral part of the Molecule ecosystemâ€”decentralized platforms that empower innovators and researchers to bring their projects to life, track progress on-chain, and share milestone achievements with their communities.

Through **Data Rooms**, projects gain secure access to an immutable, decentralized, and distributed repository where both confidential and public files can be stored. This allows communities and newcomers to follow project developments in real-time, fostering transparency and enabling data-driven decision-making. These insights can inform trading decisions via [molecule.xyz](https://molecule.xyz), our DeSci focused token screener.

### Purpose of Molecule Labs

* **Empower Research and Innovation:** Provide decentralized infrastructure for researchers and innovators to launch, manage, and grow their projects on-chain.
* **Enable Transparent Collaboration:** Use Data Rooms to store and share project files securely, fostering open access and real-time community engagement.
* **Bridge Science and Markets:** Equip communities with tools like the DeSci token screener (molecule.xyz) to track progress and make informed participation or trading decisions.
