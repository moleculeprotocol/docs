# ðŸ’® How to register inventions?

## **How it work**

1. **Connect** \
   To get started, visit and connect to the [Proof of](https://poi.molecule.xyz/)[ Invention App](https://poi.molecule.xyz/). Your wallet will serve as your _identity_ for idea registration.
2. **Present your Invention**\
   Drop your invention as digital filesâ€”these can include docs, sketches or images, code, or other formats. The content of your idea remains private and secure, as it is not uploaded to any service. You are simply presenting your confidential files.
3. **Create a timestamped proof**\
   After presenting your digital files, the system generates a unique hash and anchors it on-chain, creating a transaction that links your idea to your wallet. This hash serves as an immutable record of your invention, timestamped to the exact moment of creation. The proof cannot be altered, ensuring the integrity of your invention.
4. **Verify ownership**\
   When needed, you can easily prove to the system and to others ownership of the invention by revealing only a portion of the proof (e.g., a specific file), without disclosing the entire set of files or original content. This allows you to maintain confidentiality while validating your claim to the invention. Itâ€™s important to keep an original and exact copy of the files you presented to prove that you are the original creator.
5. **Mint an IP-NFT (Optional)**\
   If you decide to take the next step in protecting your idea, you can mint an IPNFT from a Proof of Invention (PoI). This IP-NFT will ensure you have legitimate ownership over Intellectual Property rights associated with your idea, enabling you to tokenize your intellectual property and engage in future transactions or collaborations.&#x20;

**Important Note:**\
Proof of Invention (PoI) is complementary to the existing patent system but does not serve as a provisional patent or patent application. While PoI can ensure the originality of your idea compare to preview ideas registered in the app,  it does not guarantee the novelty or patentability of the idea. \
\
No content is disclosed during the process, meaning the novelty cannot be assessed, and prior art searches cannot be performed. If you wish to confirm the novelty of your idea or protect your idea through a patent, we recommend consulting with a patent professional to explore traditional patent filing options.
