# ðŸ’¡ Why Molecule?

Disrupting early-stage bio-pharma can change the world.&#x20;

Ineffective incentive alignment means potentially promising scientific research projects all too often are abandoned for lack of funding before they get off the ground. For new drugs, the gap between foundational research and clinical trials is called "the valley of death."&#x20;

Molecule aims to cross "valley of death" by making markets for funding science and building tools for researchers to manage rights and permissions to their IP and R\&D data using cryptography on [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org).&#x20;

You can find a good entry-level blog post on this on Medium:&#x20;
