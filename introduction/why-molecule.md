# ðŸ’¡ Why Molecule?

Early-stage bio-pharma research suffers from complex legal agreements, missing transparency, and reduced investments. This leads to potentially promising research projects all too often being abandoned before they get off the ground. Academia has termed the problem of missing funds between fundamental research and clinical trial "the valley of death".&#x20;

Molecule aims to solve the "valley of death" with markets for funding research projects. Via Molecule, researchers can manage rights and permissions for their IP and R\&D data using blockchain tokens and wallets on Ethereum.
