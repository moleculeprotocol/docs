# ðŸ’¡ Why Molecule?

Molecule develops products that addresses the inefficiencies and funding gaps in traditional scientific research. It enables fractional governance of IP through novel technological solutions such as IP-NFTs and IP Tokens (IPTs), facilitating a more democratic and transparent funding process. This empowers researchers by providing new avenues for funding while allowing funders and the public to directly support and benefit from scientific advancements.

Benefits:

* **Transparency**: All transactions and ownership records are stored on the blockchain, ensuring complete transparency and trust.&#x20;
* **Liquidity**: Tokenizing IP allows for easier buying, selling, and trading, providing liquidity to an otherwise illiquid market.
* **Accessibility**: Molecule opens up opportunities for a broader range of funders to participate in IP markets, democratizing access to innovation.
* **Security**: Blockchain technology ensures the security and immutability of IP records, protecting against fraud and unauthorized changes.

Our value proposition:

1. **Decentralization**: Unlike traditional IP management systems, Molecule operates on a decentralized network, reducing reliance on intermediaries.
2. **Smart Contracts**: Automated smart contracts streamline transactions and enforce agreements, reducing administrative burdens and costs.
3. **Global Reach**: Molecule's platform connects innovators with a global network of funders and collaborators, enhancing the potential for cross-border partnerships and funding, fostering scientific breakthroughs
