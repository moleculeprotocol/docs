# ðŸ—º IP Tokenization Guide

Below is a guide on how to Tokenize an IP-NFT as a researcher or university. If you are unfamiliar with [IP-NFTs](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-nfts/intro-to-ip-nft) or [IP Tokens](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-tokens/what-are-ipts), we highly recommend you read over those sections before proceeding. This guide will go over the logistics of tokenizing an IP-NFT to further [fundraise](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-tokens/what-is-a-crowdsale-of-ipts) for the research originally funded by an IP-NFT. In short, Tokenizing an IP-NFT into IP Tokens means that the rights of a research program were originally held by a single entity (a DAO), and IP Tokens are the decentralization of those rights directly to individuals. The IP Token holders will have governance rights over the research, and selling IP Tokens via a Crowdsale is an effective way to raise funding for the research.

### Researcher Checklist

1. **Data Room:** Coordinate with the DAO project lead to create a data room. [Here](https://moleculecloud.app.box.com/v/vitafastdataroom) is an example data room from VITA-FAST, the tokenization of the VitaDAO IP-NFT supporting Viktor Korolchuk's research at the University of Newcastle. Ensure all the data included in the data room is blinded or obfuscated to minimize the risk of IP leakage.&#x20;
2. **Pitch Deck:** The data room should contain a [pitch deck](https://moleculecloud.box.com/v/vitafastdeck) to summarize the research program, showing (blinded) data generated to date, and plans for future research. This pitch deck is likely the most important piece of collateral to be created in preparation for the IP Token [Crowdsale](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-tokens/what-is-a-crowdsale-of-ipts).
3. **Presentation:** We recommend a [video recording](https://moleculecloud.box.com/v/VITAFASTProjectOverview) to go along with the pitch deck, to educate the community about the research.&#x20;
4. **Lab Tour:** Though not required, a [lab tour](https://moleculecloud.box.com/v/korolchuk-lab-tour) is an effective way to bring the community closer to your lab and research. We suggest highlighting the work and team that will be funded, as well as the instruments that will be used to conduct experiments.
5. **Press Release:** For maximum reach, we recommend a press release in collaboration between the DAO, the university technology transfer office, and the researcher. Examples are [here](https://www.lifespan.io/news/vitadao-launches-vita-fast-tokens/) and [here](https://longevity.technology/news/vitadao-launches-vita-fast-tokens-building-on-2000-initial-oversubscription/).&#x20;
6. **Create a wallet:** If the researcher will be receiving IP Tokens, those tokens will need to be held in a wallet connected to the Ethereum blockchain. We suggest holding them in a [non-custodial wallet](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/crypto-wallets-custodial-vs-noncustodial#section-custodial-crypto-wallets-pro-and-cons) such as [Metamask](https://metamask.io/download/) or [Rabby](https://rabby.io/). You will have to share your wallet address (0x...) with the DAO so they can send the IP tokens to the correct wallet.

### Research Organization Checklist

1. **Get approval:** Whether you are at a university or a private lab, legal approval for IP Tokenization is the first requirement. To help de-risk the opportunity for your research organization, the following articles may be useful collateral for convincing key decision makers.
   1. [What is decentralized science (DeSci)?](https://ethereum.org/en/desci/)
   2. [Pfizer backs VitaDAOâ€™s $4.1m funding for decentralized science](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/pfizer-vitadao-decentralized-science/)
   3. [VitaDAO Closes $4.1M Funding Round With Pfizer Ventures for Longevity Research](https://www.coindesk.com/web3/2023/01/30/vitadao-closes-41m-funding-round-with-pfizer-ventures-for-longevity-research/)

   5. [VitaDAO Launches VITA-FAST Tokens](https://www.lifespan.io/news/vitadao-launches-vita-fast-tokens/)

2. **Create a wallet:** If the research agreement between the DAO and the research organization states that the research organization has an ownership stake in any IP that comes from the research, then the research organization should expect to receive IP tokens. The IP tokens will need to be held in a wallet connected to the Ethereum blockchain. We suggest holding them in a [multi-signature wallet](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-multisig-wallet/) such as [SAFE](https://safe.global/). You will have to share your wallet address (0x...) with the DAO so they can send the IP tokens to the correct wallet.
3. **Press Release:** For maximum reach, we recommend a press release in collaboration between the DAO, the university technology transfer office, and the researcher. Examples are [here](https://www.lifespan.io/news/vitadao-launches-vita-fast-tokens/) and [here](https://longevity.technology/news/vitadao-launches-vita-fast-tokens-building-on-2000-initial-oversubscription/).&#x20;
