# üè¶ Wallets

The Molecule Protocol and dApps were designed to be used by both individuals and organizations. Individuals likely interact with Molecule's dApps via an externally-owned wallet (EOA), such as [Metmask](https://metamask.io/) or [Rabby](https://rabby.io/); however, organizations typically interact via a multi-signature wallet (multisig), such as [Gnosis Safe](https://safe.global/). Before interacting with the Molecule dApps, please familiarize yourself with EOA or multisig wallets. This will drastically improve your ability to navigate Molecule's dApps. Please find some helpful materials below to get you started.
