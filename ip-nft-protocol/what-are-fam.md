# ü´Ç What are Molecules?

Molecules are IP pool governance tokens minted by IP-NFT owners with rights given by adhesion contracts.&#x20;

Molecules unite token holders in the common purpose of constructing and developing an [IP pool](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1325659/1/1325659.pdf) for their IP-NFT.&#x20;

By unlocking powers of co-managing IP pools, participating in novel incentivization programs, advancing IP development and experimentation, and building blueprints for innovative IP networks, Molecules serve as a keystone in helping to ensure that the future of medicine belongs to everyone.&#x20;

As described herein, Molecules come with governance rights over IP licenses and monetary incentives for successful experimentation, support, and development of IP-NFTs.

The first model adhesion contract for Molecules is the FAM Agreement.&#x20;

Read our [model FAM agreement here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Iu3ALQzUa8LhIe4LIl972eGTfT296sWZZjGbtN4RbFA/edit).&#x20;

## IP licenses

Holders of Molecules have the power to grant IP licenses for the full scope of rights to [‚Äúmake,‚Äù ‚Äúuse,‚Äù ‚Äúsell,‚Äù ‚Äúoffer to sell,‚Äù and ‚Äúimport‚Äù](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/271) the IP attached to the IP-NFT. Those licenses are not automatic, but rather must be governed in and agreed upon by holders. &#x20;

For example, if a holder of Molecules finds a potential licensor of the IP, that holder can propose a vote to license the IP to that buyer.&#x20;

The purposes of these licenses are not to empower FAM token holders to become commercial manufacturers of products and services that use the IP. Instead, they are intended to empower FAM token holders to help develop and experiment with the IP. Because IP-NFTs can contain a variety of IP‚Äìtrade secrets, patents, copyright, etc. the FAM licenses help to ensure that FAM token holders have complete freedom to pursue the purpose of constructing and developing an IP Commons from the IP-NFT.&#x20;

Once the commons has achieved its purpose and the IP is ready to go into the hands of a commercial manufacturer, the licenses come to an end.

## IP non-ownership

Joint ownership of IP is [messy](https://www.ipeg.com/avoid-jointly-owned-intellectual-property/), so the IP developed through the IP pool remains owned and controlled by the owner of the IP-NFT.&#x20;

IP ownership laws conflict with each other across jurisdictions and when it comes time to transferring or exclusively licensing IP to commercial manufacturers, so joint ownership can create major inefficiencies and headaches.&#x20;

As a result, holders of Molecules don‚Äôt own the IP developed through the IP pool, they just control the IP through governance rights.&#x20;

## Governance rights

Holders of Molecules have governance rights in their IP pools. It is through these governance rights that they take on the charge of effectively co-managing the construction and development of the IP pool and any associated economic rights.

## Economic rights

Holders of Molecules can govern in a suite of monetary incentives: shares of future royalties and sales proceeds and access to bounty boards for contributions to the IP pool.&#x20;
