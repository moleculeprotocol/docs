# ðŸ«‚ What are Molecules?

Molecules are ERC-20 tokens synthesized from an IP-NFT.  &#x20;

They are IP pool governance tokens.&#x20;

Comprised of an extension of the legal and smart contracts that make up IP-NFTs, Molecules unite token holders in the common purpose of constructing and developing an [IP pool](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1325659/1/1325659.pdf) for their IP-NFT.&#x20;

By unlocking powers of co-managing IP pools, participating in novel incentivization programs, advancing IP development and experimentation, and building blueprints for innovative IP networks, Molecules serve as a keystone in helping to ensure that the future of medicine belongs to everyone.&#x20;

## Governance rights

Holders of Molecules govern the IP pools of their parent IP-NFTs.&#x20;

Their membership in the IP pool is subject to the terms of adhesion contract called the Free Association of Molecules (FAM) Membership Agreement. Read our [model FAM Membership Agreement here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Iu3ALQzUa8LhIe4LIl972eGTfT296sWZZjGbtN4RbFA/edit).&#x20;

Holders of Molecules govern the IP licensing function, controlling the parties and the terms of IP licenses and the use of proceeds from those licenses.&#x20;

## Economic rights

Unlike holders of fractions of NFTs (e.g. holders of DOG token, fractions of [The Doge NFT](https://doge.pleasr.org/) from PleasrDAO), holders of Molecules do not have hard-coded economic rights. That means they have no contractual right to proceeds in the event of the sale of the IP-NFT.&#x20;

Instead, holders of Molecules have a governance right and must vote through their exercise of such rights on the use of proceeds from IP licenses, sales, and other activity related to the IP and R\&D data in their IP pool.&#x20;

Careful consideration should be given before proposing or passing such a vote because a vote to enact a payout right will likely change the regulatory classification of the token. For example, if holders of a group of Molecules vote to approve royalty rights to themselves to receive proceeds of a license of a drug in their IP pool, then their tokens with such contractual rights would likely be considered asset tokens, securities, and similar depending on the jurisdictions of the holders.&#x20;

## IP licenses

Holders of Molecules govern the licensing of the IP-NFT's IP and R\&D data.

IP licenses attached to the IP and R\&D data of an IP-NFT must be governed in and agreed upon by holders of that IP-NFT's Molecules. &#x20;

For example, if a holder of Molecules finds a potential licensor of the IP, then the holder can propose to license the IP to that buyer. Other holders vote to license, then the license gets issued.&#x20;

## IP non-ownership

Joint ownership of IP is [messy](https://www.ipeg.com/avoid-jointly-owned-intellectual-property/), so the IP developed through the IP pool remains owned and controlled by the owner of the IP-NFT.&#x20;

IP ownership laws conflict with each other across jurisdictions and when it comes time to transferring or exclusively licensing IP to commercial manufacturers, so joint ownership can create major inefficiencies and headaches.&#x20;

As a result, holders of Molecules donâ€™t own the IP developed through the IP pool, but they do control that IP through governance rights over the IP licensing function.&#x20;
