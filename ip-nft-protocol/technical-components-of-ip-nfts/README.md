# ðŸ›  Technical Components of IP-NFTs

Molecule uses a host of services to enable the transacting of intellectual property in the form of NFTs. Below you can find a list of third-party projects and their corresponding application in the IP-NFT tech stack:

### [**Lit Protocol**](https://litprotocol.com/) **(Access Control Module)**

IP-NFTs can be used to securely manage access rights to private research data, legal agreements and IP. Molecule uses Lit Protocol to create and persist encryption keys for various use-cases. Lit Protocol nodes use secure threshold computation to store secrets so that no party besides the allowed ones ever has access to a private key. IP-NFT holders that comply to a token's access control conditions are able to retrieve the decrypted encryption key for all documents or data attached to an IP-NFT.

### [**IPFS**](https://ipfs.tech/) **(Decentralized Storage & Distribution)**

IPFS is the most well known method to address and distribute data on peer to peer networks. Since the network cannot natively guarantee persistence, we're utilising Protocol Labs' [web3.storage](https://web3.storage/) platform to pin all IPFS related content (e.g. encrypted legal documents) and automatically have Filecoin deals created.&#x20;

### [**Arweave**](https://www.arweave.org/) **(Data Storage Module)**

IP-NFTs generally are agnostic about the storage layer of their metadata and attachments. Arweave is a decentralised, permanent data storage network with  different persistence guarantees and economical mechanics than Filecoin.  We consider to additionally offer support for Arweave persistence under full custody of IP-NFT minters. Users of the Molecule IP-NFT protocol are already free to use it.

### [**Filecoin**](https://filecoin.io/) **(Persistence / Storage Module)**

To keep public and private research data persistent, Molecule implicitly makes use of Filecoin when uploading  data to web3.storage. Besides attached legal documents and IP-NFT metadata containing research project detail information, Molecule aims to also backup private research data on this distributed data storage blockchain.
