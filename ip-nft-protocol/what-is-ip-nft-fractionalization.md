# âž— What is IP-NFT fractionalization?

IP-NFT fractionalization is a method for directly distributing rights to IP-NFTs to groups of token holders by locking an IP-NFT and minting tokens on Ethereum representing fractions of the locked IP-NFT. &#x20;

Here is an issue IP-NFT fractionalization solves: when a DAO such as [VitaDAO](https://www.vitadao.com) holds an IP-NFT, the DAO members govern the IP-NFT by proxy, but those members do not have direct exposure to economic upside from the commercialization of the IP, NIPIA, or R\&D data rights attached to the IP-NFT. Instead any proceeds are returned to the VitaDAO treasury (much like proceeds from IP commercialization out of a university is returned to the university in order to fund further research) to fund additional longevity research, not distributed to DAO members, because VitaDAO is a non-profit organization. &#x20;

IP-NFT fractionalization solves this issue by enabling people to obtain direct exposure to IP-NFTs through distribution of tokenized rights that apply directly to the IP, NIPIA, and R\&D data from the sponsored research attached to the IP-NFT, instead of having only proxy exposure to it through their membership in a VitaDAO-style DAO.&#x20;

Just like IP-NFT minting, IP-NFT fractionalization happens through a mixture of legal contracts and smart contracts.

## Fractionalization Legal Contracts

### FAM Agreement

The legal contract for the first phase of fractionalization we are rolling out is the Fractional Asset Member (FAM) agreement.&#x20;

We tailor built FAM for DeSci as a new asset class enabling novel ways of organizing around IP development.

Read our [model FAM agreement here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Iu3ALQzUa8LhIe4LIl972eGTfT296sWZZjGbtN4RbFA/edit).&#x20;

In order to fractionalize an IP-NFT, the user must click to agree to the terms of the FAM agreement.&#x20;

The FAM agreement establishes that FAM holders are members of IP Commons around the IP-NFT, distributing managerial interests and financial incentives across a group of people, a.k.a. Commoners, FAM in Commons, or just "FAM."

FAM are a team charged with developing an IP Commons from the fractionalized IP-NFT.
