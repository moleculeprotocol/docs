# âž— What is IP-NFT fractionalization?

IP-NFT fractionalization is a method for directly distributing rights to IP-NFTs to groups of token holders such as members of a BioDAO.&#x20;

A user fractionalizes an IP-NFT by locking that IP-NFT and minting tokens on Ethereum representing fractions of it. &#x20;

IP-NFT fractionalization solves an issue for BioDAO members. When a BioDAO such as [VitaDAO](https://www.vitadao.com) holds an IP-NFT, the BioDAO members do not have direct exposure to economic upside from the commercialization of the IP, NIPIA, or R\&D data rights attached to the IP-NFT because any proceeds from commercialization are returned to the VitaDAO treasury to fund additional longevity research, much like proceeds from IP commercialization out of a university is returned to the university in order to fund further research at the university. Proceeds are not distributed to VitaDAO members because VitaDAO is a non-profit organization, and so are other BioDAOs.  &#x20;

When a DAO such as [VitaDAO](https://www.vitadao.com) holds an IP-NFT, the DAO members govern the IP-NFT by proxy, but those members do not have direct exposure to economic upside from the commercialization of the IP, NIPIA, or R\&D data rights attached to the IP-NFT. Instead any proceeds are returned to the VitaDAO treasury (much like proceeds from IP commercialization out of a university is returned to the university in order to fund further research) to fund additional longevity research, not distributed to DAO members, because VitaDAO is a non-profit organization. &#x20;

IP-NFT fractionalization enables people to obtain direct exposure to IP-NFTs through distribution of tokenized rights that apply directly to the IP, NIPIA, and R\&D data attached to the IP-NFT. This is direct exposure to the IP-NFT, not indirect exposure through membership in a non-profit VitaDAO-style DAO.&#x20;

## What is the fractionalization structure?

Just like IP-NFT minting, IP-NFT fractionalization happens through a mixture of legal contracts and smart contracts.

IP-NFT fractionalization happens through a mixture of legal contracts and smart contracts.

The legal contract for the first phase of fractionalization we are rolling out is the Fractional Asset Member (FAM) agreement.&#x20;

We tailor built FAM for DeSci as a new asset class enabling novel ways of organizing around IP development. FAM are a team charged with developing an IP Commons from the fractionalized IP-NFT.

In order to fractionalize an IP-NFT, the user must click to agree to the terms of the FAM agreement and then mint FAM tokens from the fractionalization smart contract.&#x20;

The FAM agreement establishes that FAM token holders are members of IP Commons around the IP-NFT, distributing managerial interests and financial incentives across a group of people, a.k.a. Commoners, FAM in Commons, or just "FAM," attaching the FAM legal contract to the FAM smart contract.&#x20;

### FRENS Agreement&#x20;

The legal contract for the second phase of fractionalization is the Fair, Reasonable, Ethical, & Non-Discriminatory Sublicense (FRENS).

We tailor built FRENS for to enable novel ways of organizing communities around ethical IP development using fungible tokens called FRENS.&#x20;

FRENS are still under development and with no certain release date.&#x20;

Users fractionalize IP-NFTs by locking them and minting tokens on Ethereum representing fractions of the IP-NFT. &#x20;

IP-NFT fractionalization solves an issue for BioDAO members. When a BioDAO such as [VitaDAO](https://www.vitadao.com) holds an IP-NFT, the BioDAO members do not have direct exposure to economic upside from the commercialization of the IP, NIPIA, or R\&D data rights attached to the IP-NFT because any proceeds from commercialization are returned to the VitaDAO treasury to fund additional longevity research, much like proceeds from IP commercialization out of a university is returned to the university in order to fund further research at the university. Proceeds are not distributed to VitaDAO members because VitaDAO is a non-profit organization, and so are other BioDAOs.  &#x20;

IP-NFT fractionalization is a solution because it solves enables BioDAO members people to obtain direct exposure to IP-NFTs through its fraction tokens.&#x20;
