# âž— What is synthesizing Molecules?

Synthesizing Molecules is a method for directly distributing rights from IP-NFTs to groups of token holders.&#x20;

A user synthesizes Molecules from an IP-NFT using the Synthesizer smart contract. Those Molecules are ERC20 tokens on Ethereum representing memberships in an IP pool unique to their parent IP-NFT. &#x20;

## Why use an IP-NFT to synthesize Molecules?

When a BioDAO such as [VitaDAO](https://www.vitadao.com) holds an IP-NFT, the BioDAO members do not have direct governance over the commercialization of the IP, NIPIA, or R\&D data rights attached to the IP-NFT. Any proceeds from commercialization are returned to the VitaDAO treasury to fund additional longevity research, much like proceeds from IP commercialization out of a university is returned to the university in order to fund further research at the university.   &#x20;

Molecules enable people to obtain direct governance to IP-NFTs through tokenized rights that apply directly to the IP, NIPIA, and R\&D data attached to the IP-NFTs in the BioDAO's funding pipeline.&#x20;

### Free Association of Molecules (FAM) Membership Agreement

The first legal contract for Molecules is an adhesion contract called the the Free Association of Molecules (FAM) Membership Agreement.&#x20;

Read our [model FAM agreement here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18mWC\_8Q0pfKP0zSjvG09JFbI0W5DHLDqySmjNz2lURY/edit?usp=sharing).&#x20;

We tailored this agreement for DeSci to enable novel ways of organizing around IP development through IP pools. IP pool memberships are represented as Molecules and governed by the FAM agreement.
