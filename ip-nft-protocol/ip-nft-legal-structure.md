# üèõ IP-NFT legal structure

The legal structure of an IP-NFT is a set of two legal contracts attached to a smart contract, enabling on-chain registration of IP and R\&D data rights.&#x20;

The legal contracts, developed with tier-1 law firms, consist of a Sponsored Research Agreement (SRA) (and a similar type of contract such as a Joint Development Agreement (JDA)) and an Assignment Agreement.&#x20;

## Legal Contract 1: The SRA (or JDA, etc.)

The SRA (or JDA, etc.) is entered into between the researcher and the sponsor, or funder, of the research, giving IP and R\&D data rights to the sponsor in exchange for research funding.

Templates of these legal contracts are available in the [Molecule Github](https://github.com/moleculeprotocol/Legal-Contracts).  &#x20;

## Legal Contract 2: The Assignment Agreement

The Assignment Agreement assigns the SRA (or JDA, or other similar agreement) to the owner of the NFT, thereby serving as the bridge between legal contract and smart contract.&#x20;

By attaching the IP and R\&D data rights to the IP-NFT, the Assignment Agreement brings those rights on chain onto Ethereum.&#x20;

A clause in the Assignment Agreement allows for the rights attached to the IP-NFT to travel with the IP-NFT when the IP-NFT is transferred to a new holder:\
\
_The rights, obligations, title and interest in and to the Agreement shall be encumbered to, and travel with, \[\[IP-NFT ID]] such that any entity, including any subsequent assignee, in lawful possession of \[\[IP-NFT ID]] shall be deemed the owner of the rights, obligations, title and interest in and to the \[\[Sponsored Research Agreement]]_.&#x20;

A template of the Assignment Agreement is available in the [Molecule Github](https://github.com/moleculeprotocol/Legal-Contracts).&#x20;

This blending of legal contracts with a smart contract is the underlying structure of the IP-NFT.&#x20;
