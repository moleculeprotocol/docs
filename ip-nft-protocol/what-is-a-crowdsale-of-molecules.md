# ðŸ‘¨ðŸ‘©ðŸ‘§ðŸ‘¦ What is a Crowdsale of Molecules?

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Alice and Bob place bids in a Crowdsale of VITA-FAST Molecules. The Crowdsale has a 2-day Sale Period. The total bids (20 ETH) exceeded the Fundraise Goal (16 ETH), so the refunds (4 ETH + 4,000 VITA) are returned after the Sale Period ends and the Crowdsale is settled. Because VITA is the Locked Token for this Crowdsale, only the amount of VITA locked can be bid in the Crowdsale. Refunds are given <em>pro rata at the conclusion of the Sale Period;</em> Alice's bid (15 ETH) was three times Bob's bid (5 ETH), so her refund (3 ETH + 3,000 VITA) is three times Bob's (1 ETH + 1,000 VITA). After settlement, allocations of Molecules can be claimed, but are locked (non-transferrable) for the duration of the 60-day Locking Period. After the Locking Period, Locked Molecules and vested VITA (vVITA) can be unlocked, making them transferrable.</p></figcaption></figure>

## Step 1 Â· Make a bid

You'll need to stake and lock Staked Tokens to submit a bid in the auction for [Molecules](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-nft-protocol/what-are-fam), which are governance tokens of an [IP-NFT](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-nft-protocol/intro-to-ip-nft). Importantly, **your bid amount cannot exceed the value of Staked tokens** you're willing to stake.

**The more you bid, the larger your final allocation of Molecules will be**, should the sale be successful (meeting its fundraising goal). If the auction is unsuccessful (doesnâ€™t meet its fundraising goal), then all of your tokens can be claimed as a refund.

## Step 2 Â· Claim Tokens and Refund

If the sale is successful then **your bid will be settled pro rata**. This means your final allocation of Molecules will depend on your bid's proportion to the total amount bid.

After the sale period, visit the page where the sale took place (or access the corresponding smart contract directly). Here, you'll be able to claim your allocation of Molecules and any overflowed bid tokens.

**The Molecules you purchase will be vesting along with the Staked tokens you locked** when you made your bid. You'll receive a vesting token, which is non-transferable and allows you to participate in governance, until you claim the vested Molecules and Staked Tokens.

## Step 3 Â· Unlock Tokens

**Once the vesting period is over, return to the sale page** to claim your tokens.

Here, you'll be able to swap your vesting Staking tokens for Staking tokens and your vesting Molecules for Molecules.

Participating in an auction for Molecules is an opportunity to support projects you believe in, but please make sure you understand the process and the risks involved by reading the relevant [whitepaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1otAhZSDouPE6X-q-vra3WExwMMLDYOPwBgbfoDoG\_q8/edit?usp=sharing), and don't hesitate to ask for help on Discord **if you have any questions.**
