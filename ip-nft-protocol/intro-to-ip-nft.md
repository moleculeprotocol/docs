# âš¡ Intro to IP-NFT

**IP-NFTs connect Intellectual Property to Non-Fungible Tokens.**&#x20;

IP-NFTs form a bridge between Intellectual Property (IP) and cryptocurrency, specifically Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), empowering scientists to embrace a new source of funding for their research and new means for transacting on their discoveries. By merging legal contracts, such as sponsored research agreements and patent licenses, with Ethereum smart contracts, IP-NFTs introduce a quantum leap in the evolution of scientific agreements.

With IP-NFTs, legal contracts find a new home within the immutable realm of smart contracts on Ethereum. This digitization paves the way for new possibilities. IP-NFTs can be seamlessly transferred peer-to-peer. They enable the equitable distribution of license and governance rights to communities, catalyzing collective intelligence and participation in shaping the destiny of scientific discoveries. Importantly, IP-NFTs unlock a world of composability with Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols, enabling integration of IP assets into the vibrant ecosystem of financial instruments and applications. By bridging the realms of IP and DeFi, IP-NFTs enable novel and powerful financial interactions and opportunities.

The impact of IP-NFTs is far-reaching, revolutionizing liquidity in IP markets and instilling a sense of excitement and possibility within the scientific community. These pioneering advancements exemplify how real-world legal rights can be seamlessly digitized, shared, and harnessed for the betterment of scientific progress.
