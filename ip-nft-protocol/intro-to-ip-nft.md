# âš¡ Intro to IP-NFT

The IP system is broken. IP-NFTs can help fix it.

IP-NFTs are [building blocks](https://molecule.to/blog/ip-nfts-for-researchers-a-new-biomedical-funding-paradigm) for the DeSci economy, like [DeFi legos](https://www.defipulse.com/blog/what-is-defi) for decentralized science. They represent legal rights to IP and research and development data; can be fractioned for distributed ownership, licensing, and governance; have [composability](https://blog.aragon.org/what-is-composability/) with DeFi; unlock new ways to interact with and develop IP (and [NIPIA](https://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/files/IntangibleAssets.pdf) (Non-IP Intangible Assets) like trade secrets and publicity rights); bring forth never-before-seen powers of crowd control of ethics in commercialization based on [FRAND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable\_and\_non-discriminatory\_licensing) terms, and create unprecedented liquidity in IP markets.&#x20;

In this documentation we explain why and how to mint IP-NFTs and some, but not all, of the risks involved. This documentation includes a library of contract templates to use in generating and managing IP-NFTs plus links to resources to learn more.

Molecule has written extensively about the general needs for such a technical infrastructure and the current implementation of IP-NFTs on Medium:&#x20;
