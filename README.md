# ðŸ”¬ What is Molecule?

Our mission is to reduce human suffering by advancing scientific research. We aim to support translational science and transform discoveries into cures through the tokenization of intellectual property.\


We envision a future where the public directly stewards the best scientific research to market. In this future, the best translational science is funded and developed by communities with aligned incentives. Researchers can spend more time conducting research and less time applying for funding. We aspire to create a global, interoperable intellectual property system that enables fast and fair collaboration.\


Molecule focuses on using emerging technologies in biotechnology and translational research. We have created a decentralized platform, Catalyst, dedicated to revolutionizing the access to funding and the development of scientific research. By utilizing blockchain technology, Molecule facilitates the tokenization of intellectual property (IP), transforming them into liquid, tradable assets or [IPTs](ip-tokens/what-are-ipts.md). This new approach empowers researchers, patients, and investors to collaboratively fund and govern and promote scientific innovation.
