# ✨ How to participate in a Crowdsale of Molecules?

## Step 1 · Make a bid

You'll need to stake and lock Staked Tokens to submit a bid in the auction for [Molecules](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-nft-protocol/what-are-fam), which are governance tokens of an [IP-NFT](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-nft-protocol/intro-to-ip-nft). Importantly, **your bid amount cannot exceed the value of Staked Tokens** you're willing to stake.

**The more you bid, the larger your final allocation of Molecules will be**, should the sale be successful (meeting its fundraising goal). If the auction is unsuccessful (doesn’t meet its fundraising goal), then all of your tokens can be claimed as a refund.

## Step 2 · Claim Tokens and Refunds

If the sale is successful then **your bid will be settled pro rata**. This means your final allocation of Molecules will depend on your bid's proportion to the total amount bid.

After the sale period, visit the page where the sale took place (or access the corresponding smart contract directly). Here, you'll be able to claim your allocation of Molecules and any overflowed bid tokens.

**The Molecules you purchase will be vesting along with the Staked Tokens you staked** when you made your bid. You'll receive a vesting token, which is non-transferable and allows you to participate in governance, until you claim the vested Molecules and Staked Tokens.

## Step 3 · Unlock Tokens

**Once the vesting period is over, return to the sale page** to claim your tokens.

Here, you'll be able to swap your vesting Staked Tokens (vVITA) for Staked Tokens (VITA) and your vesting Molecules for Molecules.

Participating in an auction for Molecules is an opportunity to support projects you believe in, but please make sure you understand the process and the risks involved by reading the documentation of the original project, and don't hesitate to ask for help on Discord **if you have any questions.**
