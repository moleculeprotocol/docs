# ➗ What is synthesizing Molecules?

The IP-NFT Protocol hopes to create a world in which IP rights aren't held solely by a select few but are instead shared amongst many passionate contributors. That's what Molecules offer. Molecules are the dawn of a new era in IP management — they provide fractional governance of IP assets.&#x20;

Harnessing the power of Molecules provides a platform to democratize the rights of IP-NFTs, distributing them across groups of token holders. This process is brought to life through the Synthesizer smart contract, which enables an IP-NFT holder to synthesize Molecules.

But these Molecules aren't just digital tokens; they're memberships, invitations to be part of an IP commons that is unique to their parent IP-NFT. They represent the community's voice, a share in decision-making, and the collaborative shaping of IP's future. This leap towards the future is much more than a technological development; it's a manifestation of collective governance, empowerment, and a shared sense of ownership. Welcome to the future of IP management, where everyone has a vote, and that vote is enforced by censorship-resistant code.

### Free Association of Molecules (FAM) Membership Agreement

The first legal contract for Molecules is an adhesion contract called the the Free Association of Molecules (FAM) Membership Agreement. We tailored this agreement for DeSci to enable novel ways of organizing around IP development through IP commons. IP commons memberships are represented as Molecules and governed by the FAM agreement.
