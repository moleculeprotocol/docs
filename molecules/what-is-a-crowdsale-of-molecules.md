# ðŸ‘¨ðŸ‘©ðŸ‘§ðŸ‘¦ What is a Crowdsale of Molecules?

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Alice and Bob place bids in a Crowdsale of VITA-FAST Molecules. The Crowdsale has a 2-day Sale Period. The total bids (20 ETH) exceeded the Fundraise Goal (16 ETH), so the refunds (4 ETH + 4,000 VITA) are returned after the Sale Period ends and the Crowdsale is settled. Because VITA is the Staked Token for this Crowdsale, only the amount of VITA locked can be bid in the Crowdsale. Refunds are given <em>pro rata at the conclusion of the Sale Period;</em> Alice's bid (15 ETH) was three times Bob's bid (5 ETH), so her refund (3 ETH + 3,000 VITA) is three times Bob's (1 ETH + 1,000 VITA). After settlement, allocations of Molecules can be claimed, but are locked (non-transferrable) for the duration of the 60-day Locking Period. After the Locking Period, Locked Molecules and vested VITA (vVITA) can be unlocked, making them transferrable.</p></figcaption></figure>
