# ↗️ Catalyst Bonding Curve

Catalyst uses a price curve that defines the relationship between the price and supply of a token. In Catalyst, this mechanism ensures dynamic pricing and transparent funding for projects.\
\
Here's an in-depth look at how this works.

## Key Features of the Bonding Curve

#### **1. How are IPTokens priced:**

* The bonding curve establishes a direct relation between the token's supply and its price.
* As more tokens are minted (supply increases), the price rises.
* Conversely, when the contribution is withdrawn (supply decreases) during the funding period, the price per token falls.

#### **2. Initial Token Offering:**

* At the start of a project, tokens are offered at a lower price.
* This incentivizes early contributors by allowing them to purchase tokens cheaply, encouraging early support and funding.

#### **3. Dynamic Pricing:**

* The bonding curve adjusts token prices in real-time based on current supply and demand.
* The unidirectional, functional pricing model allows users to contribute at a predictable price increase and also comes with a built-in slippage protection.

#### **4. Incentives for Participation:**

* Early participants benefit from lower initial token prices.
* As the project progresses and more tokens are minted, the price of the tokens increases, rewarding early backers.

#### **5. Summary: Benefits of the Bonding Curve**

* Fair Pricing: Ensures that token prices are fair and reflective of actual demand.
* Incentivizes Early Support: Rewards early backers with lower token prices.
* Liquidity Provision: Maintains liquidity, allowing tokens to be bought and sold easily.
* Predictable Funding: Provides a predictable and transparent funding mechanism for projects.\


By leveraging a bonding curve, Catalyst creates a dynamic and fair environment for funding innovative projects.
