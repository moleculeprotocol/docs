# ðŸ’¸ How do I improve my chances of being funded?

Besides inviting reviewers and preparing high-quality project files, it is crucial to engage actively with the community of funders. Catalyst stands out from traditional grant systems by allowing individuals to directly fund research, which often leads to their deeper involvement through questions or suggestions. This direct engagement can significantly influence their funding decisions. Therefore, it is essential for project creators to address community inquiries effectively or delegate this task to ensure the project's funding success.

In contrast to the conventional grant funding process, where applications are submitted and decisions are made months later with minimal interaction, Catalyst aims to enhance research funding by fostering ongoing dialogue between researchers and funders.
