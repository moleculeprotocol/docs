# üßë‚Äçüî¨ How to get funding? \[WIP]

### Am I a good fit for getting funding via Catalyst?

Catalyst projects are created by **researchers** or **sourcers**, research associates who list a researcher's project for funding on their behalf. Here are a few criteria to consider before applying for funding on Catalyst:

* You (or a colleague) have a promising translational research idea and seek funding to develop it
* You are looking for collaborators to develop your research idea with
* You are willing to negotiate a research agreement with the funders / sponsors and your organization
* You are comfortable communicating and sharing regular research updates with your research funders

If you meet the above criteria, follow the steps below to list a project for funding on Catalyst.
