# ðŸŒ± What are Seed tokens?

Seed tokens are the core of Catalyst and the substrate that drives the success of projects. These tokens have several utility functions that are both general to all users of Catalyst and specific to individual user types.

### **What are Seed tokens?**

Seed tokens are cryptographic tokens generated on [Base](https://www.base.org/), an Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain. Each Seed token instance is uniquely associated with a project on Catalyst. Project creators, or 'Sourcers', initiate a new instance of Seed tokens when they launch a fundraising campaign.

### What do seed tokens do?

* **Grant Access to Discussions**: Seed tokens provide exclusive access to private chats and forums dedicated to specific projects.
* **Enable Governance**: Seed token holders can influence project decisions, including the terms of funding and selecting the project execution team.
* **Reserve IP Tokens**: If the project is successfully tokenized, Seed token holders can swap their IP Seed tokens for [IP Tokens](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-tokens/what-are-ipts), which grant direct IP governance rights.
* **Signal Market Interest**: The trading and value of Seed tokens reflect real-time market interest and viability of projects.
* **Facilitate Liquidity and Trading**: Seed tokens are always exchangeable, providing continuous liquidity that enables backers to reallocate their contributions.

### **How is the price of a project's Seed tokens determined?**

When a project is created on Catalyst, an instance of Seed tokens is created with it. The first 100 Seed tokens, representing .1% of the total potential supply, are allocated (pre-minted) to the Sourcer. Thereafter, Seed tokens are available for purchase via a [bonding curve](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/advanced-trading/what-is-a-bonding-curve) mechanism, where the price of tokens increases linearly with each purchase. This dynamic pricing is determined by a linear bonding curve using native ETH as currency. Notably, 95% of each contribution directly supports the project funding, with the remaining 5% temporarily held as escrow fees. When a project is successfully funded,  the bonding curve market is closed, but Seed token holders become enabled to trade with each other.&#x20;
