Creating an account on Catalyst
{% endembed %}

### **Step 1: Go to** [**Catalyst**](https://app.catalyst.molecule.xyz/)

### Step 2: Click the 'Connect Wallet' button (top-right corner)

### Step 3: Select your login of choice

* **If you don't have an Ethereum wallet:** You can login with your email address or social login to create a Privy embedded wallet. However, this wallet will be unique to Catalyst, and you will not be able to use it across other applications. If you are interested in creating an externally-owned account, that you can use with other applications, learn more [here](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-tokenization-guide/wallets).
* **If you already have an Ethereum wallet:** Click 'Continue with a wallet' and connect your wallet there.

_Note: Catalyst is still in closed beta. If you are participating in the early-access beta program, you will need to login via the email you shared with us. If you receive a message that says "You don't have access to this app", please fill out the_ [_application form_](https://moleculeprotocol.typeform.com/to/ccjED8E2#source=Gitbook) _so that we can add your email to the allowlist._

* In the top-right hand corner, click the button called **Edit Profile**
  * Set a username, which will be used across Catalyst
  * Connect your email (if you haven't already)
