# How does the numeric notation work?

### Numeric Notation

In Catalyst, you might encounter numbers expressed in a notation designed to handle very small values efficiently, particularly when dealing with tokens priced in ETH. This notation uses a subscript to indicate the number of leading zeros after the decimal point before a significant figure appears. For example, a subscript of 6 followed by 53 represents the number 0.00000053 ETH.
