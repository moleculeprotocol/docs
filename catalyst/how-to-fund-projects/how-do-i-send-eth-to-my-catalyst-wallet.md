Catalyst operates on the Base. Don't send your funds to Ethereum mainnet. If you do have ETH on a wallet on Ethereum mainnet, see the section: [_Send ETH from Ethereum Mainnet to Base_](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/catalyst/how-to-fund-projects/how-do-i-send-eth-to-my-catalyst-wallet#send-eth-from-an-existing-wallet-on-ethereum-mainnet-to-base).
