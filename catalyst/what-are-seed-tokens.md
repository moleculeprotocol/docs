# ðŸŒ± What are Seed tokens?

Seed tokens are the core of Catalyst and the fuel that drives funding. These tokens have several utility functions that are both general to all users of Catalyst and specific to individual user types.

### **What are Seed tokens?**

Seed tokens are cryptographic tokens generated on [Base](https://www.base.org/), an Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain. Each Seed token instance is uniquely associated with a project on Catalyst. Project creators, or 'Sourcers', initiate a new instance of Seed tokens when they launch a fundraising campaign.

### What do seed tokens do?

### **How is the price of a project's Seed tokens determined?**

Upon the initiation of a project and Seed token creation, the first 100 Seed tokens, representing .1% of the total potential supply, are pre-minted and allocated to the Sourcer. Thereafter, Seed tokens are available for purchase via a [bonding curve](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/advanced-trading/what-is-a-bonding-curve) mechanism, where the price of tokens increases linearly with each purchase. This dynamic pricing is determined by a linear bonding curve using native ETH as currency. Notably, 95% of each contribution directly supports the project funding, with the remaining 5% temporarily held as escrow fees.
