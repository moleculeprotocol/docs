# üßê How to review projects?

### Am I a good fit to review projects via Catalyst?

Catalyst projects are reviewed by experts in a particular field. Here are a few criteria to consider before signing up to review projects on Catalyst:

* If you consider yourself an expert in a particular field relevant to projects on Catalyst
* If you are comfortable being compensated in cryptocurrency-based tokens
* If you want to make connections with other ecosystem participants
* If you want to participate in a more open and collaborative funding mechanism for research

### How to leave a review?

**Step 1: Navigate to the project you wish to review**

**Step 2: Login by clicking the Connect button**

**See something different?**

This likely means you don't hold at least one Seed token and need to purchase one in order to get access to the project's discussion.

#### Step 5: Enter a title, write your review, and click Submit

### What should I include in my review?

What you include in your review on Catalyst should depend on your area of expertise. For example, if you are a **scientist**, note the scientific risks, how they can be addressed, and highlight key missing details in the planned experiments.&#x20;

* Different types of risk
* Stay in your zone of competency&#x20;
* Try and back up any claims you make with data or publications
* Link / cite relevant references
* Be constructive - remember the Seed tokens only become worth something if the project is funded and tokenized - try and make your feedback not constructively critical
