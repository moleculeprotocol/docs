# üë©‚Äçüíª Invite Reviewers

### Why would I invite others to my project?

Executing cutting edge research is difficult, and having a strong team of incentivized collaborators can help. Inviting other users to your project is a mechanism to align interests between multiple collaborators on a project. If you believe someone else may be be value additive to your project, and you value their input, inviting them to your project can serve as an incentive for them to provide feedback and amplify your project to others.&#x20;

Whether it‚Äôs giving scientific advice, determining optimal commercial strategies, or navigating complex regulatory considerations, having a team with varied skills can push your project forward and spread the word about your project. In short, inviting others to your project and using incentives like Seed tokens can boost your resources and broaden the reach and impact of your work. It‚Äôs all about pooling together diverse talents and driving toward shared success.

### Step 1: Retrieve the wallet address of your desired recipient

Every Catalyst user has a wallet address (starting with 0x). This will be the address you use to identify and invite them. If the user is not yet a Catalyst user, they will first have to [create an account](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/catalyst/getting-started-create-an-account). Assuming they are already a user, have them send you their wallet address by clicking the top right button, followed by the double squares next to their wallet address.&#x20;

### Step 2: Navigate to the 'Invite' tab

### Step 3: Input the recipient's wallet address and number of tokens

1. Paste the address of the recipient retrieved in Step 1 into the 'Recipient' input field.&#x20;
2. In the 'Amount' input field, put in the number of tokens you would like to send to the reviewer.&#x20;
3. Click Send and confirm the transaction
