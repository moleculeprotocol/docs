# üßë‚Äçüî¨ How to get funding?

### Am I a good fit for getting funding via Catalyst?

Catalyst projects are created by **researchers** or **sourcers**, research associates who list a researcher's project for funding on their behalf. Here are a few criteria to consider before applying for funding on Catalyst:

* You (or a colleague) have a promising translational research idea and need funding to develop it
* You are looking for collaborators to develop your research idea with
* You are willing to negotiate a research agreement with the funders / sponsors and your organization
* You are comfortable communicating and sharing regular research updates with your research funders

If you meet the above criteria, follow the steps below to list a project for funding on Catalyst.

**Step 1: Prepare Your Project Files**&#x20;

Gather all the information about your project including what medical problem it addresses, the innovative solution you're proposing, and how you plan to carry it out. Include your team's credentials, a timeline, a budget, and any supportive documents like patents or publications to make your project more appealing.

**Step 2: Submit a Project Proposal**&#x20;

Go to the Catalyst homepage and click 'Launch Project' to start. Upload your project files, set your fundraising goal in ETH, and a deadline. When you submit, you'll get 100 Seed tokens to help bring reviewers on board who can provide valuable feedback.

**Step 3: Invite Reviewers**&#x20;

Use the 'Invite' tab to send Seed tokens to potential collaborators. These tokens can encourage them to contribute their expertise in science, strategy, or regulations to your project.

**Step 4: Engage with Funders and Reviewers**&#x20;

Stay active in discussions with your funders through the forum and chat features on Catalyst. Answering their questions and considering their suggestions can help increase their involvement and potentially your funding.

**Step 5: Convert ETH to USDC (Optional)**&#x20;

If you meet your funding goal, consider converting the ETH you've raised to USDC. This stablecoin can offer more financial stability than ETH and is often preferred by traditional institutions.

**Step 6: Finalize Research Agreement and Funding Terms**&#x20;

Once funding goal is reached, draft a research agreement using the templates provided by DeSci.Codes or your research institution. Share it in the project forum for feedback and approval from funders. The Molecule team can help you negotiate the agreement with your research institution, need be. This agreement needs to be finalized before the three-month deadline.&#x20;

**Step 7: Mint IP-NFT and Distribute IP Tokens and Funding**&#x20;

After the agreement is in place, mint an IP-NFT to tokenize the agreement and distribute IP Tokens that represent IP governance rights to funders, team members, and your organization. Finally, convert the raised funds into fiat currency and transfer them to your institution.

**Step 8: Claim Rewards**

Once a project is successfully funded, tokenized, and IP Tokens have been distributed, the sourcer can claim the project fees. These fees serve as a reward for successfully bringing a funded project to fruition on the platform.
