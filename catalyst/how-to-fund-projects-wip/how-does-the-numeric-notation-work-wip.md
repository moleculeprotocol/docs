description: An explanation for the numeric notation used on Catalyst.

# How does the numeric notation work? \[WIP]

Some numbers on Catalyst may be presented in an unfamiliar notation. This notation is useful for dealing with small numbers, especially for tokens priced in ETH, which is very valuable relative to other (Seed) tokens.&#x20;

For small numbers where there is a 0.0 followed by a subscript, the subscript denotes the number of zeroes the come before the following number. For example, the number below has a subscript of 6, followed by 53. In simple notation, this number is 0.00000053.
