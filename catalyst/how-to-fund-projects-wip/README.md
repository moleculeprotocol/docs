# ðŸ’² How to fund projects? \[WIP]

### Am I a good fit to fund projects via Catalyst?

Catalyst projects are funded by patients, scientists, philanthropists, and web3 users alike. Here are a few criteria to consider before funding projects on Catalyst:

* You want to support early stage scientific research with biotech applications
* You are interested in funding research via a novel mechanism: tokenization of intellectual property
* You are looking for a stake in the IP of the projects you contribute to
* You would enjoy getting a front-row seat into the research project, interacting with the scientists and getting updates from them

If you meet the above criteria, follow the steps below to fund projects on Catalyst.

### Load your Catalyst wallet with ETH

To fund projects on Catalyst, you will need to have ETH tokens on your account. There are several options to send ETH to your Catalyst wallet.&#x20;

* Send ETH from another wallet or Centralized Exchange (Coinbase, Binance, etc.)
* Send ETH from an existing wallet on Ethereum Mainnet to Base
* Send fiat currency to Catalyst with your bank account or credit card

If you need help performing any of these, please see the page: [_Sending ETH to your Catalyst wallet_](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/catalyst/how-to-fund-projects-wip/sending-eth-to-your-catalyst-wallet-wip)
