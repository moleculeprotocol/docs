# ðŸ’² How to fund projects? \[WIP]

### Am I a good fit to fund projects via Catalyst?

Catalyst projects are funded by patients, scientists, philanthropists, and web3 users alike. IHere are a few criteria to consider before funding projects on Catalyst:

* You want to support early stage scientific research with biotech applications
* You are interested in funding research via a novel mechanism: tokenization of intellectual property
* You are looking for a stake in the IP of the projects you contribute to
* You would enjoy getting a front-row seat into the research project, interacting with the scientists and getting updates from them

If you meet the above criteria, follow the steps below to fund projects on Catalyst.

### Step 1: Load your Catalyst wallet with ETH

#### Sending ETH from another wallet or Centralized Exchange (Coinbase, Binance, etc.)

**If you have:**

* ETH on Base (on a different wallet) or&#x20;
* ETH on on a centralized exchange (Coinbase, Binance, etc.)

**Here's how to send ETH to your Catalyst wallet:**

1. Copy your Catalyst wallet address by clicking the top right button,&#x20;
2. Click the double-squares next to the wallet address. This will copy the address to your clipboard.&#x20;
3. Once copied, send ETH to this wallet address when prompted to do so.

Note**:** Catalyst operates on the Base. Don't send your funds to Ethereum mainnet. If you do have ETH on a wallet on Ethereum mainnet, see _Bridging ETH from Ethereum Mainnet to Base_ below.

#### Bridging ETH from Ethereum Mainnet to Base

If you have ETH on an Ethereum Mainnet wallet, you can bridge that ETH to Base and send it to your Catalyst wallet by performing the following steps:

1. Try contribute ETH to a project. You should receive a dialogue saying you have insufficient ETH.
   1. You can also click the button in the top right hand corner of the app (0x...).
2. Click the button that says _Bridge ETH from L1_
3. Connect your Mainnet (L1) wallet
4. Input how much ETH you want to send
5. Click Deposit ETH
6. Wait \~10 minutes and your ETH should arrive in your Catalyst wallet on Base
