# ðŸ’² How to fund projects?

## Step 1 - Discover a Project&#x20;

### Set Up or Connect a Wallet:

* Make sure you have a compatible cryptocurrency wallet set up and funded with Base ETH. Recommended wallets include[ MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), Coinbase Wallet, and[ Rainbow Wallet](https://rainbow.me/), among others that support ERC-20 tokens. Catalyst also supports embedded wallets via social login, such as email.
* Connect your wallet to the Catalyst platform using the provided connect button. Ensure you are on the correct network,[ Base Network](https://www.base.org/).

### Review Projects:

* Browse the available projects on Catalyst.
* Select a project you are interested in and review the project details, including information about the lead researcher, funding goals, research impact, and go-to-market strategy and more.

## **Step 2 - Contribute Base ETH**

### Contribute to a Project:

* On the project page, enter the amount of Base ETH you wish to contribute.
* To get Base ETH, you can onramp funds directly using Moonpay / Coinbase or bridge funds
* Confirm the transaction in your wallet and wait for it to be processed.

## **Step 3 - Receive IPTs**

Post-Funding Process: Once the funding goal of the selected project is reached, the negotiation phase begins. This phase can last a maximum of 12 weeks. During the negotiation phase funds are locked in the project's wallet. After the negotiation is completed, the IP-NFT will be minted and 1.000.000 IPTs will be issued.

### Receive Tokens:

* You'll receive IPTs that correspond to the ETH amount you contributed.
* These tokens will be sent to your wallet and can be managed or traded.

Refund Policy: If the project does not reach its funding goal before the deadline, youâ€™ll get a full refund of your contributed ETH.&#x20;
