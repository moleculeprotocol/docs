# ðŸŒ± Catalyst Introduction

### What is Catalyst

Catalyst is a platform that accelerates translational research by bringing researchers, experts, and funders together to streamline the discovery, refinement, and funding of early-stage ideas into intellectual property.

### Objective

Catalyst aims to bridge the funding gap in early-stage biotech research, addressing the mismatch between research impact and funding, and navigating the challenges of translating academic research to market-ready solutions.

### Key Benefits

* **Researchers** can fund their research ideas and receive contributions from industry experts to refine their idea into a viable R\&D program.
* **Sourcers** can earn income by launching funding campaigns, rally a team of collaborators, and create promising R\&D programs.
* **Funders** can find and fund promising projects and directly govern research-related IP.
* **Experts** have the chance to discover projects that can benefit from their expertise, and apply it to guide academic research towards successful commercialization.

### How Catalyst Works

1. Sourcers publish research projects, seeking expertise and funding.
2. Experts collaborate with sourcers to develop the research idea into a feasible R\&D program, receiving compensation for their contributions.
3. Backers conduct due diligence, and contribute funds to promising projects.
4. If the funding goal is reached, sourcers, backers, and Molecule negotiate and finalize a research agreement.
5. If backers decide to accept the research agreement, an [IP-NFT](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-nfts/intro-to-ip-nft) is minted and funds are released.
6. If an agreement is approved, IP rights are assigned according to the SRA, researchers receive the funds to kickoff their work, and backers receive [IP tokens](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-tokens/what-are-ipts).
7. If the fundraising goal is unmet or the SRA negotiation fails, backers are refunded their contributions.
