# What should I include in my review?

* Different types of risk
* Stay in your zone of competency&#x20;
* Try and back up any claims you make with data or publications
* Link / cite relevant references
* Be constructive - remember the Seed tokens only become worth something if the project is funded and tokenized - try and make your feedback not constructively critical
