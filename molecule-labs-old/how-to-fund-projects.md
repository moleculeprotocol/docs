# üí≤ How to fund projects?

## **How To Guide**

In this How-to Guide, we will walk you through the steps to fund science on Catalyst. We'll cover wallet connecting, discovery, funding a project and receiving IP Tokens.

Let's get started! \

### **Part #1. Get Ready to fund science!**

#### **1. Connect your wallet**

The first step is to connect your Ethereum wallet. Start by clicking the connect button.

If you already have a wallet, you can select it from the list of available options. If you don‚Äôt have a wallet, you can log in with email or a social account and a wallet will be created for you.

Alternatively, you can create your own [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/en-gb/wallet).

#### **2. Ensure your wallet holds ETH on Base**

{% hint style="info" %}
**ETH on Base.** Refers to the native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), used on the Base blockchain network.
{% endhint %}

After connecting and accepting the terms & conditions, you will need ETH on Base to fund projects. To get ETH on Base, we offer some quick links. After connecting the wallet you can open the wallet dropdown and find a ‚ÄúGet ETH‚Äù button. On the Project Page you‚Äôll find also the ‚ÄúGet ETH‚Äù button this will redirect you to a service where you can purchase or bridge it.

* Via a centralized exchange, like [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com/) or [Binance](https://www.binance.us/)
* Via a decentralized exchange, like [UniSwap](https://app.uniswap.org/) or [Balancer](https://balancer.fi/)
* Via an on-ramping service, like [Ramp](https://ramp.network/buy) or [Moonpay](https://www.moonpay.com/buy)

You can also bridge tokens from Mainnet to Base.

* Via a bridge service, like like [Brid.gg](https://www.brid.gg/base?token=ETH\&originChainId=1\&amount=)

If your ETH on Base token balance is below the minimum amount required to participate, the interface will prompt you to purchase or to bridge tokens.

### **Part #2. Fund Science**

#### **1. Explore Projects**

Find projects that are currently live in Catalyst. You can support projects that show show a "Fundraising" status tag.

#### **2. Fund a Project**

On the project page, enter the amount of ETH on Base you wish to contribute. Confirm the transaction in your wallet and wait for it to be processed. After the transaction is confirmed you‚Äôll find your wallet address and the amount funded visible in the Activity tab in the Funders section.

### **Part #3. Claim** [**IPTs**](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-tokens/what-are-ipts)

Post-Funding Process: Once the funding goal of the selected project is reached, the negotiation phase begins. This phase can last a maximum of 12 weeks\*. During the negotiation phase, funds are locked in the project's wallet. After the negotiation is completed, the project‚Äôs IP-NFT will be minted and IP Tokens will be issued.

#### **1. Receive Tokens**

* You'll be able to claim IP Tokens that correspond to the ETH amount you contributed.
* These tokens need to be added to your wallet where then can be managed or traded.

**Refund Policy**: \
\
