# ðŸ’Š What are IP Tokens?

## Definition&#x20;

Intellectual Property Tokens (IPTs) are ERC-20 tokens that are minted using IP-NFTs. IPTs are an extension of the legal and blockchain-based contracts that constitute the IP-NFT Protocol. IPTs enable governance over IP-NFTs and their attached IP, gathering token holders under a shared objective: to proactively drive the development and advancement of valuable IP.

### Significance:

* **On-chain Opportunities:** IPTs open up new avenues for supporting cutting-edge research and development projects on-chainâ€‹, as on-chain portfolios can contain IP rights related to innovative scientific research.\

* **Market Liquidity:** by tokenizing IP rights, IPTs enable increased liquidity and market accessibility. This creates a dynamic marketplace where IP assets can be transferred , thus enhancing their utility.\

* **Access to Funding:** IPTs allow IP owners to raise funds by selling governance rights. This makes it easier for researchers and innovators to obtain the necessary resources to advance their projects without relying solely on traditional funding mechanisms.
