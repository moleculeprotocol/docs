# âš¡ Intro to IP-NFT

Intellectual Property Non-Fungible Tokens (IP-NFTs) provide a secure and immutable proof of ownership for intellectual property on-chain. These tokens ensure that the details of IP ownership are unique, transparent and tamper-proof, enabling researchers to assert ownership, raise funds, and monetize IP.
