# Intellectual property NFTs (IP-NFTs)

To get access to the market of investors, your research project can be tokenized. This basically means that a unique digital representation of the research project will be added to the blockchain in the form of a non-fungible token. This token will represent the legal rights given in a formal agreement formed with investors in exchange for funding IP or research. You can learn more about the technical and legal setup of an IP-NFT on our medium Blog:&#x20;
