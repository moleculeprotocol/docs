# ðŸ‘©ðŸ”¬ For Researchers

At its core Molecule's mission is to help biopharma researchers find resources and partners to conduct their research project. A recurring problem in early-stage biopharma research is the lack of funding and the time it takes to acquire such funding. There are several reasons for this, including complex contracts, lack of access to funding, and the difficulties of aligning multiple stakeholders.

Molecule tackles these problems with its unique IP-NFT framework. Our team has a collection of standardized legal agreements that will be connected to non-fungible tokens, enabling any researcher to collect funding from existing early-stage investors.
