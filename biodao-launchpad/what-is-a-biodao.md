# üåê What is a BioDAO?

A BioDAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organisation (DAO) leveraging decentralised services in the space of decentralised science (DeSci) to shape the future of therapeutic development. DAOs are communities of people with different backgrounds jointly allocating resources to a certain course. In the case of monetary resources, public decentralised ledger technology ("DLT"), such as  Ethereum, is used to enable all parties to collaborate trustless and democratically decide on resource allocation.

One of those services is the tokenization of intellectual property rights (IP) with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to create liquid IP-NFTs. Those IP-NFT can be bought, held, managed and sold by DAOs enabling them to contribute to the advancement of science.
